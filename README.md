# test-automatic-radar

## Setup
1. Allow write permissions to GitHub workflows (to enable PR comments by GitHub Actions bot).
    - In the repository go to Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions > Choose "Read and write permissions" > Save
2. Copy `.github/workflows/auto-agentic-radar.yml` from this repository into your repository.

## Usage
1. Create a commit in your feature branch.
    - If the files you are commiting contain an agentic workflow created with a framework, mention the name of the framework inside your commit message
    - Currently supported frameworks:
        - crewai
        - langgraph
        - openai-agents
        - n8n
    - Example commit message: "init version of my_workflow using crewai"
2. When you are ready, open a PR.
    - note: if you are opening a PR with multiple commits, make sure that the last commit message contains name of the agentic framework used
    - you can then continue to add commits with any message, just make sure to add the name of the framework each time you want to generate a report
4. GitHub workflow will take all the files added/updated in your PR and run Agentic Radar on them.
5. When the workflow finishes, GitHub Actions Bot will leave a comment on your PR in which you can find the link to the report generated by Agentic Radar.
     - Alternatively, you can find the report by visiting the run of your GitHub Action and downloading the generated artifact
